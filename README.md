# Domain adaptation Workshop

In this repository, we can find the implementations for the *Workshop* project of the *Machine Learning* course. Each folder contains the code corresponding to the section of the article with the same name.

### Structure of the repository
* CLASS CRITERION
  * *MNIST_pretrained.ipynb*: pretraining of the neural network using the MNIST dataset.
  * *MNSIT_pretrained_model.h5*: file that stores the pretrained model obtained in the above notebook.
  * *usps_dataset.h5*: file that stores the USPS dataset.
  * *Basic_Transfer_Learning.ipynb*: performs the transfer learning in two different ways (freezing and fine-tuning).

* STATISTIC CRITERION
  * *usps_dataset.h5*: file that stores the USPS dataset (same as above).
  * *Statistic_Criterion.ipynb*: performs the statistic criterion approach

* ADVERSIAL METHODS
